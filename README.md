# Event Notifier

The Event Notifier is used to monitor event logs and report events to the user in real time. This can be extremely helpful when 
troubleshooting software which reports information to the event logs.  Often it is hard to connect usage with the actual errors logged.
The tool simplifies this process by reporting event log entries to the user in real time making the troubleshooting process much more 
efficient!

The tool is simply an Event Log Monitor. For this reason it works with any version of Windows and can monitor any event log. 
This makes it useful in debugging and troubleshooting any application that writes events to the Windows event logs.
